        "Which statement is true of the following module?\n\n|---zoo\n|-- staff\n|-- Vet.java",
      options: [
        "A. The directory structure shown is a valid module.",
        "B. The directory structure would be a valid module if module.java were added directly underneath zoo/staff.",
        "C. The directory structure would be a valid module if module.java were added directly underneath zoo.",

        "F. None of these changes would make this directory structure a valid module.",
      ],
      answer: ["E"],
      explanation:
        "Modules are required to have a module-info.java file at the root directory of the module. Option E matches this requirement.",

        "F. requires transitive",
        "G. None of the above",
      ],
      answer: ["B"],
      explanation:
        "Options A, C, and E are incorrect because they refer to directives that don't exist. The exports directive is used when allowing a package to be called by code outside of the module, making option B the correct answer. Notice that options D and F are incorrect because of requires.",

      answer: ["G"],
      explanation:
        "The -m or --module option is used to specify the module and class name. The -p or --module-path option is used to specify the location of the modules. Option D would be correct if the rest of the command were correct. However, running a program requires specifying the package name with periods (.) instead of slashes. Since the command is incorrect, option G is correct.",

      answer: ["D"],
      explanation:
        "A service consists of the service provider interface and logic to look up implementations using a service locator. This makes option D correct. Make sure you know that the service provider itself is the implementation, which is not considered part of the service.",

      answer: ["E", "F"],
      explanation:
        "Automatic modules are on the module path but do not have a module-info.java file. Named modules are on the module path and do have a module-info. Unnamed modules are on the classpath. Therefore, options E and F are correct.",

        "E. The uses directive allows the use of reflection.",
        "F. The uses directive declares that an API is called.",
      ],
      answer: ["A", "F"],
      explanation:
        "Options C and D are incorrect because there is no use directive. Options A and F are correct because opens is for reflection and uses declares that an API consumes a service.",

      ],
      answer: ["A", "B", "E"],
      explanation:
        "Any version information at the end of the JAR filename is removed, making options A and B correct. Underscores (_) are turned into dots (.), making options C and D incorrect. Other special characters like a dollar sign ($) are also turned into dots. However, adjacent dots are merged, and leading/trailing dots are removed. Therefore, option E is correct.",

      options: [
        "A. Modules with cyclic dependencies will not compile.",

        "D. A cyclic dependency always involves at least two requires statements.",
        "E. An unnamed module can be involved in a cyclic dependency with an automatic module.",
      ],
      answer: ["A", "D"],
      explanation:
        "A cyclic dependency is when a module graph forms a circle. Option A is correct because the Java Platform Module System does not allow cyclic dependencies between modules. No such restriction exists for packages, making option B incorrect. A cyclic dependency can involve two or more modules that require each other, making option D correct, while option C is incorrect. Finally, option E is incorrect because unnamed modules cannot be referenced from an automatic module.",

    {
      question:
        'Suppose you are creating a service provider that contains the following class. Which line of code needs to be in your module-info.java?\n\npackage dragon;\nimport magic.*;\npublic class Dragon implements Magic {\n\tpublic String getPower() {\n\t\treturn "breathe fire";\n\t}\n}',

        "F. provides magic.Magic with dragon.Dragon;",
      ],
      answer: ["F"],
      explanation:
        "The provides directive takes the interface name first and the implementing class name second and also uses with. Only option F meets these two criteria, making it the correct answer.",

        "E. The module-info.java file contains a compiler error.",
        "F. The module-info.java filename is incorrect.",
      ],
      answer: ["B", "C"],
      explanation:
        "Packages inside a module are not exported by default, making option B correct and option A incorrect. Exporting is necessary for other code to use the packages; it is not necessary to call the main() method at the command line, making option C correct and option D incorrect. The module-info.java file has the correct name and compiles, making options E and F incorrect.",

        "H. requires transitive on line T",
      ],
      answer: ["D", "G", "H"],
      explanation:
        "Options A, B, E, and F are incorrect because they refer to directives that don't exist. The requires transitive directive is used when specifying a module to be used by the requesting module and any other modules that use the requesting module. Therefore, dog needs to specify the transitive relationship, and option G is correct. The module puppy just needs requires dog, and it gets the transitive dependencies, making option D correct. However, requires transitive does everything requires does and more, which makes option H the final answer.",
    },
    {
      question:
        "Which of the following modules are provided by the JDK? (Choose all that apply.)",
      options: [

      ],
      answer: ["A", "B", "C", "F"],
      explanation:
        "Option D is incorrect because it is a package name rather than a module name. Option E is incorrect because java.base is the module name, not jdk.base. Option G is wrong because we made it up. Options A, B, C, and F are correct.",

    {
      question:
        "Which of the following compiles and is equivalent to this loop?\n\nList<Unicorn> all = new ArrayList<>();\nfor (Unicorn current : ServiceLoader.load(Unicorn.class))\n\tall.add(current);",

        "E. None of the above",
      ],
      answer: ["D"],
      explanation:
        "There is no getStream() method on a ServiceLoader, making options A and C incorrect. Option B does not compile because the stream() method returns a list of Provider interfaces and needs to be converted to the Unicorn interface we are interested in. Therefore, option D is correct.",
    },
    {
      question:
        "Which of the following are legal commands to run a modular program where n is the module name and c is the fully qualified class name? (Choose all that apply.)",

        "F. java --module-path x -p n-c",
        "G. None of the above",
      ],
      answer: ["C"],
      explanation:
        "The -p option is a shorter form of --module-path. Since the same option cannot be specified twice, options B, D, and F are incorrect. The --module-path option is an alternate form of -p. The module name and class name are separated with a slash, making option C the answer. Note that x-x is legal because the module path is a folder name, so dashes are allowed.",

        "D. unnamed, module path",
        "E. None of the above",
      ],
      answer: ["B"],
      explanation:
        "A top-down migration strategy first places all JARs on the module path. Then it migrates the top-level module to be a named module, leaving the other modules as automatic modules. Option B is correct as it matches both of those characteristics.",
    },
    {
      question:
        "Suppose you have separate modules for a service provider interface, service provider, service locator, and consumer. If you add a second service provider module, how many of these modules do you need to recompile?",
      options: ["A. Zero", "B. One", "C. Two", "D. Three", "E. Four"],
      answer: ["A"],
      explanation:
        "Since this is a new module, you need to compile it. However, none of the existing modules needs to be recompiled, making option A correct. The service locator will see the new service provider simply by having that new service provider on the module path.",
    },
    {
      question:
        "Suppose we have a JAR file named cat-1.2.3-RC1.jar, and Automatic-Module-Name in the MANIFEST.MF is set to dog. What should an unnamed module referencing this automatic module include in module-info.java?",
      options: [
        "A. requires cat;",
        "B. requires cat.RC;",
        "C. requires cat-RC;",
        "D. requires dog;",
        "E. None of the above",
      ],
      answer: ["E"],
      explanation:
        "Trick question! An unnamed module doesn't use a module-info.java file. Therefore, option E is correct. An unnamed module can access an automatic module. The unnamed module would simply treat the automatic module as a regular JAR without involving the module.info file.",

        "E. jmod and jimage",
        "F. jmod and jmod",
      ],
      answer: ["D"],
      explanation:
        "The jlink command creates a directory with a smaller Java runtime containing just what is needed. The JMOD format is for native code. Therefore, option D is correct.",

    {
      question:
        "Which are true statements about the following module? (Choose all that apply.)\n\nclass dragon {\n\texports com.dragon.fire;\n\texports com.dragon.scales to castle;\n}",

        "D. Only the castle module can reference the com.dragon.scales package.",
        "E. None of the above",
      ],
      answer: ["E"],
      explanation:
        "There is a trick here. A module definition uses the keyword module rather than class. Since the code does not compile, option E is correct. If the code did compile, options A and D would be correct.",

      question: "Which would you expect to see when describing any module?",
      options: [
        "A. requires java.base mandated",

        "E. requires mandated java.core",
        "F. requires mandated java.lang",
        "G. None of the above",
      ],
      answer: ["A"],
      explanation:
        "When running java with the -d option, all the required modules are listed. Additionally, the java.base module is listed since it is included automatically. The line ends with mandated, making option A correct. The java.lang is a trick since it is a package that is imported by default in a class rather than a module.",

      question:
        "Suppose you have separate modules for a service provider interface, service provider, service locator, and consumer. Which module(s) need to specify a requires directive on the service provider?",

        "H. None of the above",
      ],
      answer: ["H"],
      explanation:
        "This question is tricky. The service locator must have a uses directive, but that is on the service provider interface. No modules need to specify requires on the service provider since that is the implementation. Since none are correct, option H is the answer.",
    },

      question: "Which are true statements? (Choose all that apply.)",
      options: [
        "A. An automatic module exports all packages to named modules.",

      answer: ["A", "F"],
      explanation:
        "An automatic module exports all packages, making option A correct. An unnamed module is not available to any modules on the module path. Therefore, it doesn't export any packages, and option F is correct.",

      ],
      answer: ["E"],
      explanation:
        "The module name is valid, as are the exports statements. Lines 4 and 5 are tricky because each is valid independently. However, the same module name is not allowed to be used in two requires statements. The second one fails to compile on line 5, making option E the answer.",

      question:
        "Which are true statements about a package in a JAR on the classpath containing a module-info.java file? (Choose all that apply.)",

      answer: ["A"],
      explanation:
        "Since the JAR is on the classpath, it is treated as a regular unnamed module even though it has a module-info.java file inside. Remember from learning about top-down migration that modules on the module path are not allowed to refer to the classpath, making options B and D incorrect. The classpath does not have a facility to restrict packages, making option A correct and options C and E incorrect.",

      ],
      answer: ["A", "C", "D"],
      explanation:
