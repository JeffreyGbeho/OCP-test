      answer: ["A", "B", "C", "E", "F", "G"],
      explanation:
        "A switch expression supports only the primitives int, byte, short, and char, along with their associated wrapper classes Integer, Byte, Short, and Character, respectively, making options B, C, and F correct. It also supports enum and String, making options A and E correct. Finally, switch supports var if the type can be resolved to a supported switch data type, making option G correct. Options D and H are incorrect as long and double are not supported in switch expressions.",

      answer: ["B"],
      explanation:
        "The code compiles and runs without issue, so options D, E, and F are incorrect. Even though two consecutive else statements on lines 7 and 8 look a little odd, they are associated with separate if statements on lines 5 and 6, respectively. The value of humidity on line 4 is equal to -4 + 12, which is 8. The first if statement evaluates to true on line 5, so line 6 is executed and evaluates to false. This causes the else statement on line 7 to run, printing Just Right and making option B the correct answer.",

A for-each loop also supports classes that implement java.lang.Iterable. Although this includes many of the Collections Framework classes, not all of them implement java.lang.Iterable. For this reason, option C is incorrect, and options D and H are correct. Options B, E, and G are incorrect, as they do not implement java.lang.Iterable.

      ],
      answer: ["C", "D", "E"],
      explanation:
        "Option A is incorrect because not all Collections Framework classes implement Iterable. Option B is incorrect as a while loop may execute zero times if the condition is initially false. Option C is correct. Option D is correct because a switch expression that returns a value must handle all possible input values. Option E is correct as the body of a do/while loop always executes at least once. Option F is incorrect as each if statement has at most one matching else statement.",

        "G. None of the above",

      answer: ["B", "D"],
      explanation:
        "Option A is incorrect because on the first iteration, it attempts to access weather[weather.length] of the nonempty array, which causes an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException to be thrown. Option B is correct and will print the elements in order. Option C doesn't compile as i is undefined in weather[i]. Option D is also correct and is a common way to print the elements of an array in reverse order. Option E does not compile and is therefore incorrect. You can declare multiple elements in a for loop, but the data type must be listed only once, such as in for(int i=0, j=3; â€¦). Finally, option F is incorrect because the first element of the array is skipped. Since the conditional expression is checked before the loop is executed the first time, the first value of i used inside the body of the loop will be 1.",

      explanation:
        "The first two pattern matching statements compile without issue. The variable bat is allowed to be used again, provided it is no longer in scope. Line 36 does not compile, though. Due to flow scoping, if o is not a Long, then bat is not in scope in the expression bat <= 20. Line 38 also does not compile as default cannot be used as part of an if/else statement. For these two reasons, option G is correct.",

      ],
      answer: ["A", "C"],
      explanation:
        "The code contains a nested loop and a conditional expression that is executed if the sum of col + row is an even number; otherwise, count is incremented. Note that options E and F are equivalent to options B and D, respectively, since unlabeled statements apply to the most inner loop. Studying the loops, the first time the condition is true is in the second iteration of the inner loop, when row is 1 and col is 1. Option A is correct because this causes the loop to exit immediately with count only being set to 1. Options B, C, and E follow the same pathway. First, count is incremented to 1 on the first inner loop, and then the inner loop is exited. On the next iteration of the outer loop, row is 2 and col is 0, so execution exits the inner loop immediately. On the third iteration of the outer loop, row is 3 and col is 0, so count is incremented to 2. In the next iteration of the inner loop, the sum is even, so we exit, and our program is complete, making options A and C correct.",

        "H. The code compiles but may produce an error at runtime.",
      ],
      answer: ["E"],
      explanation:
        "This code contains numerous compilation errors, making options A and H incorrect. Line 15 does not compile, as continue cannot be used inside a switch statement like this. Line 16 is not a compile-time constant since any int value can be passed as a parameter. Marking it final does not change this, so it doesn't compile. Line 18 does not compile because Sunday is not marked as final. Being effectively final is insufficient. Finally, line 19 does not compile because DayOfWeek.MONDAY is not an int value. While switch statements do support enum values, each case statement must have the same data type as the switch variable otherDay, which is int. The rest of the lines do compile. Since exactly four lines do not compile, option E is the correct answer.",

After the iteration of the first loop, sing is updated to 7, squawk to 4, and notes to the sum of the new values for sing + squawk, 7 + 4 = 11. After the iteration of the second loop, sing is updated to 6, squawk to 6, and notes to the sum of itself plus the new values for sing + squawk, 11 + 6 + 6 = 23. On the third iteration of the loop, sing > squawk evaluates to false, as 6 > 6 is false. The loop ends and the most recent value of notes, 23, is output, so the correct answer is option C.",

Option B is also correct and is one of the most common ways a reverse loop is written. The termination condition is often m>=0 or m>-1, and both are correct. Options C and F each cause an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException at runtime since both read from wolf[wolf.length] first, with an index that is passed the length of the 0-based array wolf. The form of option C would be successful if the value was changed to wolf[wolf.length-z-1]. Option D is also correct, as the j is extraneous and can be ignored in this example. Finally, option E is incorrect and produces an infinite loop, as w is repeatedly set to r-1, in this case 4, on every loop iteration.

The first loop executes a total of five times, with the loop ending when participants has a value of 10. For this reason, option E is correct. In the second loop, animals starts out not less than or equal to 1, but since it is a do/while loop, it executes at least once. In this manner, animals takes on a value of 3 and the loop terminates, making option B correct. Finally, the last loop executes a total of two times, with performers starting with -1, going to 1 at the end of the first loop, and then ending with a value of 3 after the second loop, which breaks the loop.

      explanation:
        "The most important thing to notice when reading this code is that the innermost loop is an infinite loop. Therefore, you are looking for solutions that skip the innermost loop entirely or that exit that loop. Option A is correct, as break L2 on line 8 causes the second inner loop to exit every time it is entered, skipping the innermost loop entirely. For option B, the first continue on line 8 causes the execution to skip the innermost loop on the first iteration of the second loop but not the second iteration of the second loop. The innermost loop is executed, and with continue on line 12, it produces an infinite loop at runtime, making option B incorrect. Option C is incorrect because it contains a compiler error. The label L3 is not visible outside its loop. Option D is incorrect, as it is equivalent to option B since the unlabeled break and continue apply to the nearest loop and therefore produce an infinite loop at runtime. Like option A, the continue L2 on line 8 allows the innermost loop to be executed the second time the second loop is called. The continue L2 on line 12 exits the infinite loop, though, causing control to return to the second loop. Since the first and second loops terminate, the code terminates, and option E is a correct answer.",
